# PCR-Primer-Optimal-Annealing-Temperature-Calculator
Based on the papers "_Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA amplification in vitro_" by W.Rychlik, W.J.Spencer and R.E.Rhoads (1990) and "_Predicting DNA duplex stability from the base sequence_" by K.J. Breslauer, R. Frank, H. Bl√∂cker, L.A. Marky (1986).

# Input file - Primer Sequences

Copy & paste the primer sequences in a .txt file, and the predicted product sequence in a separate .txt file. When running the file, it will first ask to input the primer .txt file, then the product .txt file. Using equations and values from the papers listed above, the optimal annealing temperature for the primers will be calculated. 

Calculations can be done for one set of forward & reverse primers at a time.
