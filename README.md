# PCR-Primer-Optimal-Annealing-Temperature-Calculator
Based on the papers "_Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA amplification in vitro_" by W.Rychlik, W.J.Spencer and R.E.Rhoads (1990) and "_Predicting DNA duplex stability from the base sequence_" by K.J. Breslauer, R. Frank, H. Bl√∂cker, L.A. Marky (1986).

# Input file - Primer Sequences and Format
Using the calculation method introduced in the above papeers, the script calculates the optimal annealing temperature in the PCR temperature profile for a given set of primers. To input the primer sequences, type them manually into the console when prompted. 

For the predicted PCR product, save the sequence onto a .txt file containing the sequence ONLY. An example file is provided.

# Output file
Outputs the optimal annealing temperature for the primer set on the console. 

# Dependencies 
1. tkinter

# Uses of the script
Can be used to optimize PCR conditions for any project involving PCR.
